## Battle Arena Attack Terms & Conditions

I, {{player}}, agree to submit an attack in {{host}} arena,
using my pet of id {{pet_id}}, attacking the enemy pet of id
{{pet_enemy_id}} using the element {{element}}.

I understand that monsters transfers are not reversible after the
{{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds or other delay as configured
by my own permissions.

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed for technical issues
or failure, I agree that I need to attempt to submit this action again,
and also the subsequent interactions that I could possibly being submitted
in this interval.
