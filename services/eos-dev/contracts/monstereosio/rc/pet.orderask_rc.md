## Monster Sell Order Terms & Conditions

I, the owner of the pet {{pet_id}}, am opening or updating
a sell order for the pet {{pet_id}}, willing to transfer the
ownership of it by the price of {{amount}}.

The new owner, {{new_owner}} will have total ownership of this monster,
as soon as MonsterEOS receives the {{amount}} transfer, takes
their market service fees and transfer the remaining amount to me.

After that, this monster will go back to me in the next {{until}}
days - 0 days means that it's a permanent order and it will never go
back to me, the old owner.

I understand that monsters transfers are not reversible after the
{{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds or other delay as configured
by my own permissions.

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed for technical issues
or failure, I agree that I need to attempt to submit this action again,
and also the subsequent interactions that I could possibly being submitted
in this interval.
