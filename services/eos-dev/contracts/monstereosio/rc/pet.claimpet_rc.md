## Monster Claiming Order Terms & Conditions

I, {{claimer}, am willing to have the ownership of the monster of
id {{pet_id}} that currently belongs to {{old_owner}} for FREE, with
NO COSTS.

From now on, I assume that I will have total ownership of this monster,
as soon as MonsterEOS receives the {{amount}} transfer, takes
their market service fees and transfer the remaining amount to me.

After that, this monster could go back to the original owner
if this Order is a temporary transfer order (rental).

I understand that monsters transfers are not reversible after the
{{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds or other delay as configured
by my own permissions.

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed for technical issues
or failure, I agree that I need to attempt to submit this action again,
and also the subsequent interactions that I could possibly being submitted
in this interval.
